ðŸ“Š **LSTM Stock Price Prediction Dashboard**
This project is a comprehensive LSTM-based Stock Price Prediction Dashboard built using Python, Dash, and Plotly. The model predicts future stock prices based on historical data using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks.

ðŸ”¥ **Key Features:**
LSTM Model: Sequential LSTM network for time-series forecasting.

Interactive Dashboard: Built using Dash and Plotly for dynamic visualizations.

Evaluation Metrics: Includes MAE, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE.

Visualization: Actual vs. Predicted stock prices with intuitive line charts.
ðŸ“Š **Technologies Used:**
Python: Data analysis and modeling

Dash & Plotly: Dashboard and visualization

Keras & TensorFlow: LSTM model development

Pandas & NumPy: Data preprocessing and manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization

ðŸ’¡**Future Improvements:**
Add more advanced LSTM architectures.

Integrate real-time data fetching from an API.

Expand the dashboard with additional visualizations.
